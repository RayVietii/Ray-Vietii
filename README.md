 # Ray Vietii

🎨 Artist | ✍️ Writer/Worldbuilder | 🎼 Composer | 🧠 ML Enthusiast

Hey there — I'm Ray Vietii.  
I explore machine learning, fantasy worldbuilding, original languages, and sound creation.  
Most of what I do is self-driven, experimental, and a bit chaotic — but it's mine.

## 🔧 Projects

- **RayVietii-DRm and Papermae** – My own fine-tuned **Stable Diffusion 1.5** models, trained for expressive anime-style generation.
- **Prinila Langua** – A conlang for my fantasy world. Includes grammar, poetic structure, and over 400+ lexicons.
- **Class V Amplifier** – An analog amp design I've been developing from scratch, based on a logic-style topology.
