# Ray Vietii

🎨 Artist | ✍️ Writer/Worldbuilder | 🎼 Composer | 🧠 ML Enthusiast

Hey there, I'm Ray Vietii.  
I explore machine learning, fantasy worldbuilding, original languages, and sound creation.  
Most of what I do is self-driven, experimental, and a bit chaotic, but it's mine.

I'm also known as Rico 'Ray Vietii' Prayoga
